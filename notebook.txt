For this assignment, there are no functions at all which can be unit tested, therefore we did not write unit tests.

We demonstrate that the replicas can be on different machines by running the servers on different AWS instances.

Server Pending Messages Persistence:

Server Replication:
We accomplish 2-fault-tolerance with the following methods:

    TODO ivan: backend side

Client 
    On the frontend, the client knows the addresses of all three servers.
    When it initially tries to connect, it starts iterating through the addresses, attempting to call the RPC find_leader.
    Whichever server the client connects to will tell the client which is the leader. The client now knows where to open the
    gRPC channel.

    If, the client is operating and any one of the replicas goes down, nothing will happen because the leader is up,
    and the client is connected to the leader.
    But, if the client is operating and the leader goes down, then the client will get a _InactiveRpcError. When this happens,
    we catch the exception and find the new leader again by iterating through the addresses and calling the find_leader RPO.

Otherwise, everything is the same as the gRPC implementation of HW1. If it ain't broke don't fix it.



To demonstrate that we accomplish the two features for this assignment, we do the following demos:
Feature 1: Persistent Storage
    Show for 1 server it can go down / up and messages persist. Show same for 2 servers and 3 servers. 
    Can ask the audience which order to send the servers down to show this is arbitrary.
Feature 2: 2-fault tolerance
    Spin up A, B, C, test (show normal operation on client side). 
    Shut down A, test. 
    Shut down B, test. 
    Restore A, test. 
    Restore B, test. 
    Shut down C, test. 
    Also can ask the audience to choose order of which servers to kill to show this is arbitrary.
